            <p>
              My name is Karl Magnus Nøkling, and I'm a Front-End Developer specializing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks like Bootstrap & React. And React Native for mobile applications. I have completed the study "Front-End Development" (2 years) at Noroff.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a strong passion for creating innovative solutions that simplify and enhance the digital experience. With expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am well-equipped to build modern and engaging websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of my journey, I have developed a website for a company providing high-quality clothing and accessories for infants and kids. This experience has honed my skills in creating user-friendly and visually appealing web solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Problem-solving is my forte, and I am committed to persevering until the finished project meets my own high standards and the specific requirements of my clients. I take pride in tackling complex coding scenarios and delivering exceptional results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Effective communication is essential in my work. I am fluent in English and Norwegian, and I have a good understanding of Swedish and Danish, which enables seamless collaboration with clients and colleagues from diverse backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides web development, I am constantly exploring new technologies and industry trends. I thrive on taking on exciting and unique projects that allow me to unleash my creativity and deliver outstanding outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have any inquiries or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out to me through the <a class="contactPage" href="/html/contact.html">contact page</a> on my portfolio website.
